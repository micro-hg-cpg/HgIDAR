A data frame with 7 rows and 6 columns:
\describe{
\item{isotope}{isotopic component}
\item{isotope_198, isotope_199, isotope_200, isotope_201, isotope_202}{isotopic composition of each spike and natural}

abundances_1

\description{
It contains the isotopic abundance for the analysis.
This example contains only isotopes 198 through 202 because those are the ones relevant for this example.
The isotopic composition of the spikes can be either measured along with the samples,
or you can use the certificates values provided by the company when you bought the enriched isotopic solution.
If you used isotopic dilution with double incubation to measure the transformations (e.g. IHg to MMHg and MMHg to IHg),
you need to add all four of the spikes to your abundance table.
Additionally, one isotope needs to remains unchanged, this means that the
isotope that you choose to be your natural need to have the natural abundance values.
