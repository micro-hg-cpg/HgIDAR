\title{Calculates concentration of the inorganic (IHg) isotopes in sediments}
\usage{
mean_IHg(
  x,
  y,
  z,
  samples,
  injections = 3,
  type = c("liquid", "solid"),
  quant_IHg,
  spike_concentration_IHg
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame with your integrated peaks}

\item{y}{data frame with your masses}

\item{z}{data frame with your abundances}

\item{samples}{Numeric vector. Number of samples}

\item{injections}{Numeric vector. Number of injections per sample Default = 3}

\item{type}{Type of sample: liquid or solid}

\item{quant_IHg}{IHg isotope used for the quantification}

\item{spike_concentration_IHg}{Concentration of the organic Hg quantification spike. Units: ng/g}
}
\value{
Table with the mean sample concentrations and the standard deviations for each isotope.
}
\description{
The mean concentration of IHg and their standard deviations of the different isotopes are returned in a table. Mean and sd are calculated with the injection values.
}
